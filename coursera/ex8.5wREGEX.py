# When you find a line that starts with 'From ' like the following line:
# From stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za Sat Jan  5 09:14:16 2008
# You will parse the From line using split() and print out
# the second word in the line
# (i.e. the entire address of the person who sent the message).
# Then print out a count at the end.

# Hint: make sure not to include the lines that start with 'From:'.
